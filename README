HTML Email generation for all those silly HTML emails you have to markup.

Places for improvement:

* markup for spacer images
* some sort of tool to help with the math associated with columns
* optimize code so it doesn't regenerate ALL tags when input is changed
* Checkboxes for when you want to enable / disable stuff (for example, ability to not specify size)
